# Predicting Depression - Kaggle Playground Series S4E11

This repository contains my solution for the [Kaggle Playground Series - Season 4, Episode 11](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/playground-series-s4e11/overview).

## Summary of Results

In this competition, the goal was to predict depression using structured binary classification. The following models and results were achieved:

- **CatBoostClassifier**: 93.9%
- **XGBoostClassifier**: 93.8%
- **Combined Model**: 93.8%

The combination of models was implemented to maximize prediction accuracy. The provided notebook demonstrates the steps taken to preprocess the data, train the models, and evaluate their performance.

## Repository Contents

- `Predicting_Depression_Structured_Binary_Classification.ipynb`: Main notebook containing the entire workflow, from data preprocessing to model evaluation.
- Supporting files and scripts for reproducing the results.

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Depression-Prediction.git
   ```
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Predicting_Depression_Structured_Binary_Classification.ipynb
   ```
3. Follow the steps in the notebook to preprocess data and train the models.

## Results Visualization

Results were evaluated using a test dataset, which was uploaded into kaggle
